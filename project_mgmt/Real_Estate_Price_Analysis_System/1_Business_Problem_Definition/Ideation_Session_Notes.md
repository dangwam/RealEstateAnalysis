## Date: [Insert Date]
### Attendees:
- CEO / Founder
- Product Manager
- Data Science Team
- Real Estate Analysts
- Marketing Team
- IT Team

## Session Agenda:
1. Identify the problem that needs to be solved.
2. Discuss key features for the real estate price prediction system.
3. Determine data sources and machine learning methods for price prediction.
4. Explore potential user interface designs and features.
5. Discuss integration with other tools or platforms.

### Key Ideas and Insights:
- **Price Prediction Models**:
  - Use machine learning algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) for predicting real estate prices.
  - Incorporate features such as location, square footage, number of rooms, proximity to key amenities (schools, transportation), etc.

- **Data Sources**:
  - Public real estate data (e.g., Zillow, Redfin) for historical pricing information.
  - Government data on infrastructure developments and population growth.
  - User input data: Property details (size, location, condition) entered by users.

- **User Interface**:
  - Simple and intuitive web interface for users to input property details.
  - Display predicted prices along with factors affecting the prediction.
  - Option for users to compare properties side-by-side.

- **Advanced Features**:
  - Implement a heatmap visualization to show real estate price trends across different regions.
  - Add predictive analytics for real estate investment opportunities (e.g., areas with rapidly increasing property prices).

## Next Steps:
- Define the technical architecture.
- Research available datasets and data collection methods.
- Plan the machine learning model development and testing phases.
