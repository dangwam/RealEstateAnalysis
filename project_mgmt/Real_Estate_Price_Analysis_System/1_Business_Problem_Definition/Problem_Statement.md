# Problem Statement

## Background
- Real estate prices have been steadily increasing over the years in major cities, creating challenges for potential homeowners and investors.
- There is a need for a tool to analyze the factors affecting real estate prices and provide predictions for future price trends.

## Objective
- The goal of this project is to develop a system that can predict real estate prices based on historical data and various influencing factors (location, property size, number of bedrooms, etc.).
- The system will help buyers, sellers, and investors make more informed decisions regarding real estate investments.

## Scope
- The system will analyze data for properties located in urban areas (cities and suburbs).
- Focus on residential properties (houses, apartments, condos).
- Predictive analysis of property prices based on available data points.

## Deliverables
- A functional real estate price prediction model.
- Data analysis visualizations and reports.
- A web interface to input property details and get predicted price estimates.

## Key Metrics
- Model Accuracy: Evaluation of prediction accuracy using metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) or MAE (Mean Absolute Error).
- Data Coverage: The amount and quality of real estate data available for training the model.
- User Experience: The ease of use and performance of the web interface.
